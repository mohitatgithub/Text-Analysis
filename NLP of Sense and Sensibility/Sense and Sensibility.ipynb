      "Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He really pressed them,\n",

      "could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former\n",

      "\n",
      "In seasons of cheerfulness,\n",
      "no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater\n",

      "itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "To take three thousand pounds from the fortune\n",

      "\n",
      "And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "I have known a great deal of the trouble\n",

      "disagreeable she found it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Twice every year these annuities were to be\n",

      "besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which\n",
      "brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will\n",
      "pay their mother for their board out of it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Altogether, they will have\n",

      "Their housekeeping will\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the first\n",

      "home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in\n",
      "spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the\n",
      "neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at\n",
      "their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the\n",
      "wish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to\n",
      "visit any family beyond the distance of a walk. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There were but few who\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding\n",
      "valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly\n",
      "described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an\n",
      "ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little\n",

      "better acquainted with it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But they learnt, on enquiry, that its\n",

      "too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The high\n",
      "downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to\n",
      "seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy\n",
      "alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior\n",
      "beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one\n",
      "memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine\n",
      "of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the\n",
      "settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The weather was\n",
      "not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their\n",
      "book, in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would be\n",
      "lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off\n",
      "from their hills; and the two girls set off together. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at\n",
      "every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the\n",
      "animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears\n",

      "Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting\n",
      "it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly\n",
      "the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in\n",
      "their face.-- Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though\n",

      "\n",
      "One consolation however remained for them, to which the\n",
      "exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that of\n",
      "running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which\n",
      "led immediately to their garden gate. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They set off. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step\n",
      "brought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop\n",

      "bottom in safety. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was\n",

      "accident happened. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He put down his gun and ran to her assistance. \n",

      "\n",
      "She\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The gentleman offered\n",
      "his services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her\n",
      "situation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther\n",
      "delay, and carried her down the hill. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then passing through the garden,\n",
      "the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly\n",
      "into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his\n",
      "hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while\n",
      "the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret\n",
      "admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized for\n",
      "his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so\n",
      "graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received\n",
      "additional charms from his voice and expression. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Had he been even old,\n",
      "ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would\n",
      "have been secured by any act of attention to her child; but the\n",
      "influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the\n",
      "action which came home to her feelings. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address which\n",
      "always attended her, invited him to be seated. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But this he declined,\n",

      "\n",
      "His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present\n",

      "honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The honour\n",
      "was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still more\n",
      "interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the\n",
      "theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised\n",
      "against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior\n",
      "attractions.-- Marianne herself had seen less of his Mama the\n",
      "rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting\n",
      "her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their\n",
      "entering the house. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn\n",
      "for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the\n",

      "Every\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her skin was very brown, but,\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That he is patronised by YOU,\" replied Willoughby, \"is certainly in\n",

      "calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the\n",

      "\n",
      "Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for\n",
      "himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in\n",

      "This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of\n",

      "\"This,\" said he, \"cannot hold; but a change, a total change of\n",

      "Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much,\n",

      "\n",
      "His spirits, during the last two\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I\n",

      "length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all,\n",
      "as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as\n",
      "with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous\n",

      "But this did not last\n",

      "hardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause, at\n",
      "Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strange\n",
      "unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before Sir\n",

      "In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies,\n",

      "\n",

      "Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an\n",

      "visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose\n",
      "elegance,--whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof; for\n",
      "the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for\n",
      "nothing at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Their being her relations too made it so much the\n",

      "As it was impossible, however, now to prevent\n",

      "illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement, her want of\n",
      "information in the most common particulars, could not be concealed from\n",

      "advantage. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities\n",
      "which education might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with\n",
      "less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of\n",
      "rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her\n",
      "assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have no\n",
      "lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity\n",
      "with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward's\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,\n",
      "unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and though\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You may well be surprised,\" continued Lucy; \"for to be sure you could\n",

      "smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was always\n",
      "meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept so\n",

      "\n",
      "And I do not think\n",
      "Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you,\n",

      "It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me\n",
      "was often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was\n",
      "formed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he\n",

      "\n",
      "I was very unwilling to enter\n",
      "into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of\n",
      "his mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so\n",
      "prudent as I ought to have been.-- Though you do not know him so well\n",
      "as me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Certainly,\" answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No; considering our situation, it was not strange. \n",

      "and, therefore, there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name\n",
      "to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister's\n",
      "suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it.\" \n",
      "\n",

      "It does not do him justice, to be\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw the\n",
      "painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or\n",
      "her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind, she\n",
      "could have none of its being Edward's face. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "anxious to get it! \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "They then\n",
      "proceeded a few paces in silence. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lucy spoke first. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully\n",
      "keeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is to\n",
      "us, not to have it reach his mother; for she would never approve of it,\n",
      "I dare say. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding\n",
      "proud woman.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I certainly did not seek your confidence,\" said Elinor; \"but you do me\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Your\n",
      "secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so\n",
      "unnecessary a communication. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You must at least have felt that my being\n",
      "acquainted with it could not add to its safety.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover\n",
      "something in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest\n",
      "part of what she had been saying; but Lucy's countenance suffered no\n",
      "change. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,\"\n",

      "I have not known you long to be\n",
      "sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by\n",

      "if you was an old acquaintance. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides in the present case, I really\n",
      "thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anne is the only person that\n",
      "knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you must\n",

      "t'other day, when Edward's name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she\n",
      "should out with it all. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I only wonder that I am alive after what I\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Every thing in\n",
      "such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom--we can hardly\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Sometimes.\" \n",
      "\n",

      "could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all\n",
      "possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and\n",

      "engaged. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no\n",

      "\n",

      "Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the\n",
      "direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the\n",

      "for her to the two-penny post. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "She could scarcely eat any\n",

      "anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much\n",

      "\n",
      "The tea\n",

      "could not be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a few\n",
      "steps towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned\n",
      "into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard\n",
      "him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that\n",

      "indeed it is!\" \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time her\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect\n",
      "himself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of\n",

      "their journey, and the friends they had left behind. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor wished very much to ask whether\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he replied, with some embarrassment, \"almost ever since; I have\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not\n",
      "materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled\n",
      "in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty\n",
      "young people, and to amuse them with a ball. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This was an affair,\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the country, an\n",
      "unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the\n",
      "reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it\n",
      "was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it\n",
      "known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine\n",
      "couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had\n",
      "not seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to avoid\n",
      "the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and therefore\n",
      "never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on their\n",
      "entrance. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who they\n",

      "room. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered: it\n",
      "was enough--HE was not there--and she sat down, equally ill-disposed to\n",
      "receive or communicate pleasure. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After they had been assembled about\n",
      "an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his\n",

      "informed of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Impatient in this situation to be doing\n",
      "something that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved to\n",
      "write the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears\n",
      "for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been\n",
      "so long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by\n",
      "perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again\n",
      "writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any other\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on\n",

      "restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all\n",
      "that had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her\n",
      "by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account\n",
      "of her real situation with respect to him. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and\n",
      "Colonel Brandon was announced. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianne, who had seen him from the\n",
      "window, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he\n",
      "entered it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing\n",
      "satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in\n",
      "particular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It was not the\n",

      "once before, beginning with the observation of \"your sister looks\n",
      "unwell to-day,\" or \"your sister seems out of spirits,\" he had appeared\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After a pause of several minutes, their silence\n",

      "to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Elinor was not\n",
      "prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obliged\n",
      "to adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he meant? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He\n",
      "tried to smile as he replied, \"your sister's engagement to Mr.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may\n",
      "prove materially advantageous.--Her inviting you to town is certainly a\n",
      "vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks altogether so great a\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "treating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on\n",

      "\n",

      "GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper\n",

      "be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no\n",
      "hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he had some\n",
      "thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to live\n",
      "upon that?--He could not bear to think of her doing no better, and so\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "But,\n",
      "to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she\n",

      "\n",
      "one can't repeat such kind of things you\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As a friend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed I know he\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "such very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is almost\n",

      "SHOULD be all this.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish\n",
